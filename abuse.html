Properly taking care of animals can be tricky if you don’t know what to.  Some ways to properly take care of animals are, look 
				at the first 5 ingredients in the food, a least 2 of them should be high quality protein items.  
				Another thing is exercise, you could do 30 minute brisk walk or extended play time as well. 
				Taking it to the vet once a year or more is important. If you want to know more on proper pet 
				care got to <a href=”http://petcareeducation.com/dog/”> Pet Care Education</a> i got my background 
				info on this website.
